     This is the source to DirectX Bomns.  Go to http://bomns.sourceforge.net/
for the latest version of this source and the game itself.  If you have any
questions about this code, you see any huge errors in it, or there's something
obviously missing or something, don't hesitate to email me at Toxite@aol.com and
tell me.

     This code was compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (SP5, with the VC
Processor Pack), so I don't guarantee it'll work in any other compiler.  Also, I
use a tab size of 3, so obviously the source'll look best as such.
